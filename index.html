<p><b>WWW.</b></p>
The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language, documents.  HTML is the basis of almost all 30 billion pages on the web.<br>
<br>
The major components of the web are Me (or you), My computer + My browser, The Internet, HTTP protocol and Servers housing the HTML documents and respond to the HTTP requests.<br>
<br>
<p><b>HTML</b></p>
HTML is the heart of the web.  Text content is what you see or read, but Markup is what it looks like.  Plain text is plain text in HTML, but if you want to make it look different, you need to use markup/tags.  HTML is also responsible for allowing references to other documents and links to other pages.<br>
<br>
<p><b>Markup Broken Down</b></p>
Tags are essentially used to give direction to your content.  Some tags require just an opening tag (called a void tag), while others require both an opening and closing tab.  The combination of the tags and everything in between the tags is known as an <b><em>element</em></b>.<br>
<br>
Tags can also have attributes.  Attributes are used to insert links or images, such as one of my favorite cartoons below.<br>
<br>

<br>
But, it's awesome to know that I don't have to memorize all the attributes and tags available for HTML use since they are so readily available with a simple Google search.<br>
<br>
I also appreciate that spaces are inconsequential as they will turn into one single space on HTML. <br>
<br>
<p><b>Inline vs. Block Elements</b></p>
Probably some of the more confusing terms to me are inline vs. block elements.  I understand they behave differently and that block elements basically draw an invisible line around the text and that box can actually have height and width.  However, I'm sure after I practice with them more in my upcoming courses, I will get the hang of them quickly.<br>
<br>
<br>
That's it for now!  I'm <b><em>really</em></b> looking forward to diving into rest of our courses!<br>
